NAME
----
mkdumprd - (Re)build the initramfs for kdump

SYNOPSIS
--------
*mkdumprd* [-h] [-q] [-f] [-k _kernelver_] [-i _opts_]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*mkdumprd* (re-)builds the kdump initrd. For kdump, a special initrd is used
because

* the kdump initrd should include network modules and network configuration
  (and therefore is larger as the normal initrd used for booting),
* the kdump initrd should use no splash screen,
* the kdump initrd includes *kdumptool*(8) and all required libraries.

This script calls *mkinitrd*(8) with all required parameters. If the initrd
already exists, it checks first if the configuration file or the kernel are
newer, and only rebuilds the initrd if necessary.

OPTIONS
-------
All option parsing is done via the *getopt(3)* function, and therefore follows
all standard command line parsing rules.

*-h* | *--help*::
  Shows help output and exits.

*-k* _kernelversion_::
  Specifies the kernel version. If no version is specified, then the currently
  running kernel is used.

*-K* _kernel_::
  Specifies the kernel binary. If you specify that option, also specify _-I_.

*-I* _initrd_::
  Specifies the resulting initrd. If you specify that option, also specify _-K_.

*-q*::
  Be quiet. Don't output status messages. Used to call *mkdumprd*(8) from
  /etc/init.d/kdump init script.

*-i* _parameters_::
  Append the specified _parameters_ to *mkinitrd*(8) call.

FILES
-----

*/etc/sysconfig/kdump*::
  Kdump configuration. See *kdump*(5).
