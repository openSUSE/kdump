NAME
----
kdump - Configuration of kdump

SYNOPSIS
--------
/etc/sysconfig/kdump

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This configuration file provides various options for the kdump loading and
saving process. It's mostly read by *kdumptool*(8) but also by the kdump init
script.

OPTIONS
-------

The file format consists of shell variables (which means that the configuration
file is actually parsed by a *sh*(1) compatible shell) that are described below.
It's recommended to use a pair of double quotes to assign values to that
variables.


KDUMP_KERNELVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kernel Version string for the -kdump kernel, such as "2.6.25-5-kdump".
The init script will use a kernel named _/boot/vmlinu[zx]-$KDUMP_KERNELVER_.
Using "kdump" will default to the most recently installed kdump kernel
(to which the symbolic link _/boot/vmlinuz-kdump_ points).

If no version is specified, then the init script will try to find a kdump kernel
with the algorithm described below.

Default is "" which means that the auto-detection described above is used.

Kernel auto-detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's assume that a kernel name _KERNELRELEASE_ consists of _BASEVERSION_ and a
_FLAVOUR_ on SUSE. For example consider the kernel release ("uname -r")
"2.6.25.18-0.2-default". Then the _BASEVERSION_ is "2.6.25.18-0.2" (but there
are also _BASEVERSION_ strings without a dash) and the _FLAVOUR_ is "default".

To find out if a kernel is suitable as capture kernel, there are strong
and weak requirements. The strong requirements mean that you just cannot use the
kernel as kdump kernel:

* Either the kernel must be a special kdump kernel with a modified
  start address *or*
* the kernel is relocatable.

The weak requirements mean that a kernel is not good as kdump kernel so it
should be avoided when better kernels are installed. A kernel does not
fulfil that weak requirements when

* It is a realtime kernel (since the interrupt handling is different and
  _irqpoll_ has problems) *or*
* the kernel is compiled for a huge number of CPUs (above 1024 in our case)
  since that means that the capure kernel needs more memory.

After all that definition, the algorithm tries following kernels in that order:

. _BASEVERSION_-kdump (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-rc1-kdump)
. kdump (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-kdump)
. _KERNELRELEASE_ (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-rc1-kdump), strong check
. _BASEVERSION_-default (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-rc1-default), strong check
. "" (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz), strong check
. _KERNELRELEASE_ (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-rc1-kdump), weak check
. "" (e.g. /boot/vmlinuz), weak check

On each item, it tries:

. /boot/*vmlinuz
. /boot/*vmlinux

Initrd
^^^^^^

For the initrd, if the kernel name already contains "kdump", then the initrd
_/boot/initrd-<kernelver>_ is used. Else, we use
_/boot/initrd-<kernelver>-kdump_ (the kernel flavour is not replaced, so for
example this means _/boot/initrd-2.6.25.9-0.2-default-kdump_. This is because
the initrd used for kdump always has to be special, and it makes no sense to
load the normal initrd that would not save the dump.



KDUMP_COMMANDLINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Command line used to boot the kdump kernel. By default, the _/etc/init.d/kdump_
script tries to build a command line automatically from the command line of the
running system, preserving root partition, serial console, etc. If you manually
create a command line, make sure to include:

* the _root_ parameter,
* any _console_ parameters (for serial console),
* _maxcpus=1_,
* _irqpoll_,
* _reset_devices_,
* _elevator=deadline_ to save the memory footprint.

The last three parameters are special for kdump and should always be included,
if you don't have a good reason to exclude them.

If you just want have an own command line parameter to be added additionally,
use KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND.

Default is "".


KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variable describes all command line parameters that are passed to the kdump
kernel additionally to the default parameters. See also KDUMP_COMMANDLINE.

Default is "".

KEXEC_OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional options for *kexec*(8).

Default is "" except on IA64 where it is "--noio".


MAKEDUMPFILE_OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional options for *makedumpfile*(8). makedumpfile will be used to save the
dump if KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL is non-zero or KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT is not _ELF_.
Normally, you don't have to specify any options here, but you may be asked in
Bugzilla to add the _-D_ option for debugging.

Default is "".


KDUMP_IMMEDIATE_REBOOT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Immediately reboot after saving the core in the kdump kernel? Use "yes" or "no".

Default is "yes".

KDUMP_TRANSFER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A script or command executed to process and transfer the dump image.
It can read the dump image either via /proc/vmcore or /dev/oldmem. Most other
variables will have no effect if you use a custom command here.

It's important that all requirements including that script itself are included
in KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS.

It's strongly recommended that the default mechanism is used, it should provide
everything that is needed, together with KDUMP_PRESCRIPT and
KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT. We can't support problems with using that variable.

KDUMP_PRESCRIPT and KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT are not executed if KDUMP_TRANSFER is set.

Default: "".


KDUMP_SAVEDIR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory where dumps are saved to. If the directory does not exist, it will
be created. The directory is a URL and must conform to the syntax described in
the section "URL FORMAT" below. If the directory does not exist, it will be
created. (That is true for all targets, even network targets. Of course the user
must have the permission to create directories.)

Below that directory, for each dump a directory with a time stamp in the
following format will be created: "YYYY-MM-TT-HH:MM". That directory contains
the dump and various other files, depending which dump target will be used and
which dump settings are made.

If KDUMP_COPY_KERNEL is set, that directory will also contain the kernel.

Default: "file:///var/log/dump".


KDUMP_KEEP_OLD_DUMPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of old dumps to keep. That variable is only honored on local directories
(i.e., if KDUMP_SAVEDIR starts with _file_) because we think it's bad from a
security point of view if other hosts delete stuff (that may be from another
hosts) on a dump server. The deletion process takes place before the dumps are
saved. So if you specify 3 here, then after the dump has been saved, 4 dumps are
on disk.

Set that variable to "0" to disable the deletion of dumps entirely, and set
that variable to "-1" to delete all dumps, i.e. then only the just saved dump is
on disk.

Default: "5"


KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't save the dump (or delete it afterwards) if after saving the dump less than
KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE megabytes are free. Because when dump compression or dump
filtering (see KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL and KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT) is used, we don't know in
advance how large the dump will be, we have to delete the dump after saving it.

That option applies only to local file systems, i.e. KDUMP_SAVEDIR must start
with _file_.

Default: "64"


KDUMP_VERBOSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bit mask of several options that set the verbosity of the dump process. To apply
several options, you have to add their value. The options are:

1::
  kdump command line is written to system log when executing /etc/init.d/kdump.

2::
  Progress is written to stdout while dumping.

4::
  kdump command line is written so standard output when executing
  /etc/init.d/kdump.

8::
  Debugging for kdump transfer mechanism. That is executed in initrd and
  generates lots of output. However, it's very useful if something does not
  work.

16::
  Debugging when loading the kdump kernel. That creates lots of output to
  stdout, so only use if you really want to debug that. It is useful if
  kdump reports that it cannot find a suitable kernel but you think kdump
  is wrong.

So, for example, if you want to have the command line on stdout when loading the
kernel and also in the system log, just use KDUMP_VERBOSE = 5 (i.e. 1 + 4).

Default: "3".


KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determines the dump level. If KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL is non-zero, then
*makedumpfile*(8) is used to strip pages that may not be necessary for
analysing. 0 means no stripping, and 31 is the maximum dump level, i.e.
0 produces the largest dump files and 31 the smallest.

The following table from makedumpfile(8) shows what each dump level means:

'------------.----------.----------.-------------.---------.----------
dump level   zero page  cache page cache private user data free page

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Default: "0"


KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variable specifies the dump format.


*ELF*::
  _ELF_ has the advantage that it's a standard format and GDB can be used to
  analyse the dumps. The disadvantage is that the dump files are larger.

*compressed*::
  _compressed_ is the kdump compressed format that produces small dumps, see
  *makedumpfile*(8).  However, only *crash*(8) can analyse the dumps and
  makedumpfile must be installed (but you need it anyway if you set
  KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL to non-zero before).

Default: "compressed"


KDUMP_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If something goes wrong while saving the dump or deleting old dumps in initrd,
then *kdumptool*(8) normally just tries to execute the next action. However,
it can be usedful to open a shell at that point of time to fix the problem
or just debug it, therefore you can set KDUMP_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR to "true".

Default: "false"


KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a space-separated list of programs (full path) that are required by
KDUMP_TRANSFER, KDUMP_PRESCRIPT or KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT. Dynamic libraries that are
required by that programs don't have to be included as they are resolved
automatically. However, it's necessary to include other runtime requirements
because it's not possible to resolve them automatically.

Default: ""


KDUMP_PRESCRIPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program that is executed before taking the dump. You have to include that
program in KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS.

Default: ""


KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program that is executed after taking the dump and before the system is
rebooted. You have to include that program in KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT.

Default: ""


KDUMP_COPY_KERNEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not only copy the dump to KDUMP_SAVEDIR but also the installed kernel. Valid
values are "yes" and "no". If you want to have the debugging information also
copied, which is required to open the program, you also have to install the
_kernel-<flavour>-debuginfo_ package.

Modules are not copied, only the kernel image and the debugging file.

Default: "yes"


KDUMPTOOL_FLAGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a space-separated list of flags to tweak the run-time behaviour of
*kdumptool*(8). Currently, only one flag is supported:

*NOSPARSE*::
  Disable the creation of sparse-files. This flag is for debugging purposes,
  e.g. if the file system or network protocol has problems with sparse files.
  Because SFTP and FTP are not mounted, that option has no meaning when saving
  the dump to SFTP and FTP.

Default: ""

KDUMP_NETCONFIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network configuration for kdump. Because the dump process runs in initrd, the
network configuration is different from the normal network configuration. Use
_auto_ to auto-detect the network configuration, this is also the default.

Use a _netdevice:mode_ string to force a specific network device to be used. A
_netdevice_ is for example "eth0". The _mode_ can be either "dhcp" or "static".
If you use "static", you have to set the IP address with _ip=ipspec_. _ipspec_
is <client>:<server>:<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname>:<device>:<proto>. See
*mkinitrd*(8) for details.

You can set KDUMP_NETCONFIG to "" if you want no network in initrd, i.e. you use
disk dumping.

Default: "auto"

KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to get an email after the dump has been copied, you can specify an
SMTP server here. It's valid to specify a hostname, an IP address. Optionally,
you can also specify a port with the usual _:port_ syntax.

Example: smtp.myprovider.de:25

If you provide a username (KDUMP_SMTP_USER) and a password
(KDUMP_SMTP_PASSWORD), then SMTP AUTH will be used. Otherwise, plain SMTP with
no authentication will be used.

Default: ""

KDUMP_SMTP_USER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Username used for SMTP authentication. Also specify KDUMP_SMTP_PASSWORD in that
case. If no username and/or no password will be provided, plain SMTP will be
used.

Default: ""

KDUMP_SMTP_PASSWORD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Password used for SMTP authentication. Also specify KDUMP_SMTP_USER in that
case. If no username and/or no password will be provided, plain SMTP will be
used.

Default: ""

KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_TO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Email address where notification mails should be sent to. Don't specify a
real name here, only an email address. You have to configure a SMTP server with
KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER to use that feature.

Example: john@myprovider.de

Default: ""

KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_CC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Space-separated list of email addresses where notification mails should be sent
to via Cc. Don't specify real names here, only email addresses. You have to
configure a SMTP server with KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER to use that feature.

Example: "john@myprovider.de doe@myprovider.de"

Default: ""



URL FORMAT
----------

In general, the URL format is

_protocol_://_specification_

where _protocol_ is one of:

* *file*,
* *ftp*,
* *sftp* (aliases are *ssh* or *scp*),
* *nfs*
* *cifs* (alias is *smb*).

The _specification_ varies for each protocol.

Local files (_file_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That type describes a local path.

_Format:_ +file://]_path_+

As shown, the _file_ prefix is optional, i.e. a simple path is still valid.
The _path_ must start with a leading slash (/), i.e. only absolute paths are
allowed.

_Examples:_

* +/var/log/dump+
* +file:///var/log/dump+


File Transfer Protocol (_ftp_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This URL type is used to specify paths on a remote FTP server.

_Format:_ `ftp:// [ _user_ [:_password_]@ ] _hostname_ [:_port_] ] _path_`

The remote _user_ is optional, if no user is specified, anonymous FTP is
assumed. Even if a username is specified, the _password_ is optional, if no
password is specified, an empty password is used. When the username is
"anonymous", then "$USER@$HOSTNAME" is used as password because some FTP
servers deny anonymous FTP with empty passwords.

_hostname_ can be either a (DNS-)resolvable hostname, with or without a domain
name, or an IP address in totted decimal format. _port_ can be used to
specify the remote port, if no port is specified in the URL, the default FTP
port is used. Finally, _path_ must conform to the same rules as for local
files (see above).

_Examples:_

* +ftp://neptunium/var/log/dump+
* +ftp://bwalle@neptunium.suse.de/var/log/dump+
* +ftp://bwalle:dontsay@strauss.suse.de:123/var/log/dump+
* +ftp://192.168.0.70/var/log/dump+


Secure File Transfer Protocol (_sftp_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This URL type is used to specify paths on a remote server that is reachable via
SFTP. It's important that an SFTP server must be running (which is the default
on SUSE), the *kdumptool* does not use FISH (FIles transferred over SHell
protocol).

_Format:_ `sftp:// [ _user_ [:_password_]@ ] _hostname_ [:_port_] ] _path_`

It's valid to use the alias "ssh" or "scp" as alias for "sftp" (for backward
compatibility), but the "sftp" prefix is recommended.

For the elements, see the description of FTP above. Please note that the use of
an password here is not recommended. The recommended way is to add the key where
the file should be copied to to the "authorized_keys" file of the user where the
dump is saved. For example, if you want to save the dump to the "kdump" user of
the machine "collector", then generate a private/public key pair on the machine
that saves the dump with `ssh-keygen -t dsa`. Append the file _id_dsa.pub_ (in
_root/.ssh/_) to _~dump/.ssh/authorized_keys_ on "collector".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root@earth:~# ssh-keygen -t dsa
...
root@earth:~# cat /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub \
        | ssh kdump@collector "cat - >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't use any password to encrypt the key. *kdumptool* is designed to be used
non-interactively.

_Examples:_

* +sftp://kdump@collector:22/var/log/dump+
* +sftp://neptunium/var/log/dump+
* +scp://neptunium/var/log/dump+


Network File System (_nfs_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NFS is used to specify remote hosts that export their file system via NFS.
NFS doesn't use username and password. Also, the URL format cannot be used
to specify options. As default, the _nolock_ option is used.

_Format:_ +nfs://_host_ [:_port:] _path_

_host_ is the hostname, _port_ is optional (should not be used, it is only
implemented for completeness with the other URL formats). _path_ specifies
the path that is exported via NFS in _/etc/exports_ (or a subdirectory of a
path that is exported).

_Examples:_

* +nfs://neptunium/var/log/dump+
* +nfs://10.10.2.120/var/log/dump+


Common Internet File System (_cifs_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CIFS is used to specify remote hosts that export a file system via CIFS,
also known as SMB (although they are technically different, CIFS is the
successor of SMB). This could be a Microsoft Windows server, or a Samba
Server running on Unix or MacOS.

_Format:_ +cifs:// [_user_ [:_password_] @] _host_ _path_

Although it's technically not 100 % correct, _smb_ is used as an alias for
_cifs_, so the program will always return _cifs_ even if you specify _smb_.

The parts of the URL are described in the FTP section above.

*Note:* You have to use the slash as path separator, not the backslash as on
Microsoft Windows.

_Examples:_

* +cifs://neptunium/var/log/dump+
* +cifs://bwalle:dontsay@neptunium:/var/log/dump+
* +smb://bwalle@192.168.0.70:/var/log+
