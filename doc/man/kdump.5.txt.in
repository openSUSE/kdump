NAME
----
kdump - Configuration of kdump

SYNOPSIS
--------
/etc/sysconfig/kdump

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This configuration file provides various options for generating the kdump 
initramfs and the loading and saving process.

OPTIONS
-------

The file format consists of shell variables (which means that the configuration
file is actually parsed by a *sh*(1) compatible shell) that are described below.
It's recommended to use a pair of double quotes to assign values to that
variables.


KDUMP_KERNELVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kernel Version string (such as "6.3.1-2-default") or an absolute path to a kernel 
image that should be used for kdump.

Default is "" which means to use the default kernel reported by the *pbl*(8) tool.


KDUMP_CPUS
~~~~~~~~~~

This parameter can be used to limit the number of CPUs used by kdump. 
The value is passed in the _nr_cpus_ parameter to the kdump kernel and 
in the _--num-threads_ option to *makedumpfile*(8).

If the value is zero, all available CPUs are used, i.e. the _nr_cpus_
parameter is not added to the kdump kernel command line and _--num-threads_ 
is set to the number of CPUs.

Default is 0.


KDUMP_COMMANDLINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Command line used to boot the kdump kernel. By default, the _/etc/init.d/kdump_
script tries to build a command line automatically from the command line of the
running system, preserving root partition, serial console, etc. If you manually
create a command line, make sure to include:

* the _root_ parameter,
* any _console_ parameters (for serial console),
* _irqpoll_,
* _reset_devices_,

The last three parameters are special for kdump and should always be included,
if you don't have a good reason to exclude them.

If you only want to extend the kernel command line with your own parameter(s),
use KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND.

Default is "".


KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variable describes all command line parameters that are passed to the kdump
kernel additionally to the default parameters.

For network based dumping, you may have to add a _net_delay_ parameter to
specify the extra delay in seconds that is needed for the network device
to become fully operational, e.g. _net_delay=20_ will wait 20 seconds before
continuing after the network device is configured. This parameter is used by
the network setup code in the resulting initrd.

See also KDUMP_COMMANDLINE.

Default is "".

KDUMP_AUTO_RESIZE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Memory for the crash kernel is reserved at boot time. It is a large
block that must be continuous in physical address space, and such
allocations must be early because of memory fragmentation. However,
the Linux kernel allows to shrink this reserved area later, and this
is what kdump does before loading the panic kernel when this option
is turned on.

The intention is that the _crashkernel_ boot option is set to the
maximum possible value (e.g. half of available RAM), which should be
enough for the worst case. When the system boots, it checks the
actual requirements and reduces the reservation accordingly.

Note that this option is ignored if the reservation is not done by
the Linux kernel, i.e. under the Xen hypervisor, or when using
FADUMP on IBM POWER.

Default is "false".

ifeval::['@HAVE_FADUMP@'=='TRUE']

KDUMP_FADUMP
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this option is set to "true", kdump will use the FADUMP mechanism
(firmware-assisted dump). With this option, the secondary kernel is never
loaded from the primary kernel. Instead, the kdump feature is added to the
standard initrd. If the primary kernel crashes, the firmware reboots the
machine in a special environment. The initrd detects this environment on
boot, saves the dump, and continues with normal startup.

*Note:* FADUMP is only available on powerpc.

Default is "false".

KDUMP_FADUMP_SHELL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When this option is "true", kdump launches a shell after saving the dump.
If FADUMP is disabled, this option has no effect, because launching a shell
is the default action when KDUMP_IMMEDIATE_REBOOT is set to "false".

This option can be useful for debugging.

Default is "false".

endif::[]

KEXEC_OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional options for *kexec*(8).

Default is "".


MAKEDUMPFILE_OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional options for *makedumpfile*(8). makedumpfile will be used to save the
dump unless KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT is _raw_.
You may want to set this to _-X_ to exclude XEN DomU pages.

Default is "".


KDUMP_IMMEDIATE_REBOOT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Immediately reboot after saving the core in the kdump kernel? Use "true" or "false".

ifeval::['@HAVE_FADUMP@'=='TRUE']
If this option is set to "false" and FADUMP is enabled, normal boot process
continues after saving the dump. This can save one reboot, but on NUMA
systems all node-level memory is allocated on the dumping node, degrading
the performance of all other nodes until reboot.
endif::[]

Default is "true".

KDUMP_TRANSFER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A script or command executed to process and transfer the dump image.
It can read the dump image either via /proc/vmcore or /dev/oldmem. Most other
variables will have no effect if you use a custom command here.

It's important that all requirements including that script itself are included
in KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS.

It's strongly recommended that the default mechanism is used, it should provide
everything that is needed, together with KDUMP_PRESCRIPT and
KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT. We can't support problems with using that variable.

KDUMP_PRESCRIPT and KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT are not executed if KDUMP_TRANSFER is set.

Default: "".


KDUMP_SAVEDIR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory where dumps are saved to - either an absolute path or a URL.
The URL and must conform to the syntax described in
the section "URL FORMAT" below. If the directory does not exist, it will be
created, except on NFS and CIFS mounts.

Below that directory, for each dump a directory with a time stamp in the
following format will be created: "YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM". That directory contains
the vmcore dump, the dmesg and a README.txt file.

Bind mounts are not supported.

Default: "/var/crash".


KDUMP_KEEP_OLD_DUMPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of old dumps to keep. This variable is only honored on local directories
(i.e., if KDUMP_SAVEDIR is a directory or starts with _file_) because we think
it's bad from a security point of view if other hosts delete stuff (that may be
from another hosts) on a dump server. The deletion process takes place before
the dumps are saved. So if you specify 3 here, then after the dump has been
saved, 4 dumps are on disk.

Set that variable to "0" to disable the deletion of dumps entirely, and set
that variable to "-1" to delete all dumps, i.e. then only the just saved dump is
on disk.

Default: "0"


KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that at least KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE megabytes are free on the target
partition after saving the dump file. Since the target dump file size may not
be known (because of compression and/or filtering), *kdump* always attempts to
save the dump, but checks remaining free space afterwards and deletes the dump
directory again if remaining space is less than the value specified here.

This option applies only to local file systems, i.e. KDUMP_SAVEDIR must start
with _file_.

Default: "64"


KDUMP_VERBOSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bit mask of several options that set the verbosity of the dump process. To apply
several options, you have to add their value. The options are:

1::
  Print details when loading the dump kernel.

2::
  Progress is written to stdout while dumping.

4::
  (same as 1)

8::
  Debugging. The kdump-save script and most of the programs it runs 
  (including makedumpfile)  are run with debugging options.
  Generates lots of output. However, it's very useful if something does not
  work.

Default: "0".


KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determines the dump level. If KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL is non-zero, then
*makedumpfile*(8) strips pages that may not be necessary for analysing. 0 means
no stripping, and 31 is the maximum dump level, i.e.  0 produces the largest
dump files and 31 the smallest.

The following table from makedumpfile(8) shows what each dump level means:

'------------.----------.----------.-------------.---------.----------
dump level   zero page  cache page cache private user data free page

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Default: "31"


KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variable specifies the dump format.


*none*::
  Do not generate any dump file. This is useful if you only want the kernel
  log buffer, because it minimizes disk space requirements and also greatly
  reduces the time involved in waiting for the dump to complete.

*ELF*::
  _ELF_ has the advantage that it's a standard format and GDB can be used to
  analyse the dumps. The disadvantage is that the dump files are larger.

*compressed*::
  _compressed_ is the kdump compressed format that produces small dumps, see
  *makedumpfile*(8).  However, only *crash*(8) can analyse the dumps and
  makedumpfile must be installed (but you need it anyway if you set
  KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL to non-zero before).

*lzo*::
  _lzo_ is similar to _compressed_, but it uses the LZO compression algorithm
  instead of gzip. This usually results in slightly bigger files, but it is
  much faster. You will need *crash*(8) version 6.0.7 or later to open the
  dump file.

*snappy*::
  _snappy_ is similar to _compressed_, but it uses the Snappy compression
  algorithm. It is usually considerably faster and achieves approximately
  the same compression ratio. Snappy is optimized for 64-bit, little-endian
  architectures (e.g. x86_64).

*zstd*::
  _zstd_ is again similar to _compressed_, but it uses the Zstandard
  compression algorithm. While slightly slower, it can produce smaller
  files than _lzo_ or _snapy_.

*raw*::
  _raw_ creates a verbatim copy of /proc/vmcore without any processing
  with makedumpfile.
  makedumpfile is still used to extract kernel log buffer.

Default: "compressed"


KDUMP_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If something goes wrong while saving the dump or deleting old dumps in initrd,
kdump-save normally tries to execute the next action. However, it can
be useful to open a shell at that point in time and fix or debug the problem.
This happens when KDUMP_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR is set to "false".

Default: "true"


KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a space-separated list of programs (full path) that are required by
KDUMP_TRANSFER, KDUMP_PRESCRIPT or KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT. Dynamic libraries that are
required by that programs don't have to be included as they are resolved
automatically. However, it's necessary to include other runtime requirements
because it's not possible to resolve them automatically.

Default: ""


KDUMP_PRESCRIPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program or command that is executed before taking the dump. You have to include
that program in KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS.

Default: ""


KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program or command that is executed after taking the dump and before the system
is rebooted. You have to include that program in KDUMP_REQUIRED_PROGRAMS.

As a special case, if KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT contains +/usr/lib/fence_kdump_send+,
this script is automatically added to the initrd, and network is configured by
default.

Default: ""


KDUMP_NETCONFIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network configuration for kdump. Because the dump process runs in initrd, the
network configuration is different from the normal network configuration. Use
_auto_ to auto-detect the network configuration (see *auto* mode below). The
interface with the default route will be used. This is the default.

Network is configured only if needed, e.g. the dump target is on a remote
machine, or an email notification should be sent. If network is needed by
something else, such as a custom script used as KDUMP_PRESCRIPT or
KDUMP_POSTSCRIPT, add a _:force_ suffix to the network configuration, for
example "auto:force" or "eth0:dhcp4:force".

Use a _netdevice:mode_ string to force a specific network device to be used. A
_netdevice_ is for example "eth0". The _mode_ can be:

*static*::
  Always re-use the current configuration of _netdevice_ (both IPv4 and IPv6).
  Note that only permanent global IPv6 addresses are stored, because temporary
  addresses are likely to expire before the system crashes, and link-local
  addresses are set up automatically.

*auto6*::
  Use IPv6 autoconfiguration to get an address on the interface.

*dhcp*::
*dhcp4*::
  Use DHCP to configure an IPv4 address on the interface.

*dhcp6*::
  Use DHCP6 to configure an IPv6 address on the interface.

*auto*::
  Select the mode depending on the current state of the interface:

  * use DHCP4 if it has an IPv4 address (IPv6 not set up),
  * use DHCP6 if it has a permanent IPv6 address (IPv4 not set up),
  * use IPv6 auto-configuration if it has neither (IPv4 not set up).

Auto-detection cannot be used to set up dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) hosts
because of limitations in the implementation of the _ip=_ initrd command line
option.

*Note:* If an _ip=_ option is found in KDUMP_COMMANDLINE or
KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND, kdump does not add any other _ip=_ or _ifname=_
options. In other words, the value of KDUMP_NETCONFIG is effectively ignored.

Setting KDUMP_NETCONFIG to "" disables network completely. In this case, kdump
does not even add the _network_ dracut module to the initrd.

Default: "auto"

KDUMP_NET_TIMEOUT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of seconds to wait for the target machine to respond to ping.
Setting to "0" disables this timeout.
You may need to do this if the machine does not respond to ping and
KDUMP_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR is set to "false" to avoid being dropped to a
debug shell. 

Default: "30"

KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If e-mail notifications are enabled using KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_TO, you can specify an
SMTP server here. It's valid to specify a hostname, an IP address. Optionally,
you can also specify a port with the usual _:port_ syntax.

Passed to mailx using its "smtp" option.

Example: smtp.myprovider.de:25

Default: ""

KDUMP_SMTP_USER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Username used for SMTP authentication. Only use together with KDUMP_SMTP_PASSWORD 
and KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER. 

If you provide a username and a password, then SMTP AUTH and STARTTLS will be
used.

Passed to mailx using its "smtp-auth-user" option.

Default: ""

KDUMP_SMTP_PASSWORD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Password used for SMTP authentication. Only use together with KDUMP_SMTP_USER
and KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER. 

Passed to mailx using its "smtp-auth-password" option.

Default: ""

KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_TO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Email address where notification mails should be sent to. 
Notifications are sent via a kdump-notify systemd service during boot
and only work when KDUMP_SAVEDIR points to a local directory.

The service scans for new dumps present in KDUMP_SAVEDIR and
sends an e-mail notification using the mailx program, concatenating
all README.txt files from newly found dumps.

You either need to configure mailx using /etc/mail.rc or specify
KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER and optionally KDUMP_SMTP_USER and KDUMP_SMTP_PASSWORD.
When KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER is specified the kdump-notify service will wait
some time for the server to become reachable. Otherwise this is 
the responsibility of the local mailx / MTA configuration.

Example: john@myprovider.de

Default: ""

KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_CC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Space-separated list of email addresses where notification mails should be sent
to via Cc. KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_TO needs to be configured (you can't send
notifications only to Cc: addresses without a To:).

Don't specify real names here, only email addresses.

Example: "john@myprovider.de doe@myprovider.de"

Default: ""

KDUMP_HOST_KEY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Target host key and type encoded with base64, i.e. as found in
+~/.ssh/known_hosts+.  This is used for the SFTP transfer protocol to verify
the authenticity of the remote host. If this field is left empty, the setup
scripts will try to get it automatically using *ssh-keygen -F $target_host*.

If you want to disable host key checking, set this variable to "*".

Example (broken into lines for readability):

  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAxIJIeuVX0F0u53wMgH22fdl62ifLXRwaPAXPsCr
  vyerMEb5DXHnIv1sYdzlJ1g/2Iw+ppjGDh1En/P12Dpl2uLBZh0MOrM71spTjvTwV2M
  KZtXrYjZUIPIZdd9vrI+/LEI0nw7LSdnKKgkAIXMhaRrq9N6uoZWe41ilU4NpnL/k=

Default: ""

KDUMP_SSH_IDENTITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of SSH identity files for public key authentication. If empty, kdump will
copy all standard OpenSSH identities for the 'root' user (rsa, dsa, ecdsa,
ed25519). The path to every identity file is relative to +~root/.ssh+, or an
absolute path can be given.

Example: "/root/.ssh/id_kdump_rsa"

Default: ""

URL FORMAT
----------

In general, the URL format is

_protocol_://_specification_

where _protocol_ is one of:

* *file*,
* *ftp*,
* *sftp* (alias is *scp*),
* *ssh*
* *nfs*
* *cifs* (alias is *smb*).

The _specification_ varies for each protocol.

Local files (_file_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This type describes a local path.

_Format:_ [*file*://]/_path_

As shown, the _file://_ prefix is optional, i.e. a simple path is still valid.
The _path_ must start with a leading slash (/), i.e. only absolute paths are
allowed.

_Examples:_

* +/var/crash+
* +file:///var/crash+


File Transfer Protocol (_ftp_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This URL type is used to specify paths on a remote FTP server.

_Format:_ *ftp*://[_user_[:__password__]@]_hostname_[:__port__]/_path_

The remote _user_ is optional, if no user is specified, anonymous FTP is
assumed. Even if a username is specified, the _password_ is optional, if no
password is specified, an empty password is used. When the username is
"anonymous", then "$USER@$HOSTNAME" is used as password because some FTP
servers deny anonymous FTP with empty passwords.

_hostname_ can be either a (DNS-)resolvable hostname, with or without a domain
name, or an IP address in dotted decimal format. _port_ can be used to
specify the remote port, if no port is specified in the URL, the default FTP
port is used. Finally, _path_ must conform to the same rules as for local
files (see above).

_Examples:_

* +ftp://neptunium/var/crash+
* +ftp://bwalle@neptunium.suse.de/var/crash+
* +ftp://bwalle:dontsay@strauss.suse.de:123/var/crash+
* +ftp://192.168.0.70/var/crash+


Secure File Transfer Protocol (_sftp_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This URL type is used to specify paths on a remote server that is reachable via
SFTP. It's important that an SFTP server must be running (which is the default
on SUSE). 

_Format:_ *sftp*://[__user__[:__password__]@]_hostname_[:__port__]/_path_

It's possible to use "scp" as an alias for "sftp" (for backward compatibility),
but it is a misnomer; kdump does not implement the SCP protocol and it
will use SFTP instead.

See the description of FTP for an explanation of the _hostname_ and _port_
elements.

Server Identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since system dumps may contain sensitive information, *kdump* uses strict host
key checking for the target server by default. The SSH client must have a copy
of the public part of the target server's host key. The copy is kept in a
known_hosts file on the client. *Kdump* will use the key found in
+~root/.ssh/known_hosts+ when the kdump initrd is generated. 
KDUMP_SSH_IDENTITY may be used to either disable host key checking 
(not recommended) or specify an alternative host key.

Client Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The crashed system uses root's private SSH key to login to the target system by
default.  The public part of that key must be copied to the target user's
+~/.ssh/authorized_keys+ on the target host.
This should be preferred to setting the password in the URL.

Example Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To set up _crasher_ for saving dumps over SFTP to _dump@collector_, follow
these steps:

1. Add the target host public key to +~root/.ssh/known_hosts+ on _crasher_,
   e.g.:
+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root@crasher:~# ssh-keyscan -t rsa,ecdsa,ed25519 collector \
	>> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
*WARNING:* Note that the above command accepts the identity of _collector_
without any checking that it is genuine. This is a security risk unless the
network connection between _crasher_ and _collector_ can be fully trusted when
you run this command.

2. Generate a private/public key pair for the _root_ user on _crasher_, e.g.
   to make a 4096-bit RSA key, run this as _root_:
+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root@crasher:~# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Do not use any password to encrypt the key - kdump is designed to be used
non-interactively.

3. Append the content of +\~.ssh/id_rsa.pub+ to +~dump/.ssh/authorized_keys+
   on _collector_:
+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root@crasher:~# ssh-copy-id dump@collector
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Examples:_

* +sftp://dump@collector:22/var/crash+
* +sftp://neptunium/var/crash+


Secure Shell Protocol (_ssh_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike the _sftp_ URL type, this protocol does not use SFTP, but rather
transfers the data to a remote *cat* command.

_Format:_ *ssh*://[__user__[:__password__]@]_hostname_[:__port__]/_path_

Most of the notes for SFTP also apply to SSH, except:

* SFTP need not be configured on the target host.
* Shell access must be granted to the dump user.
* The shell must allow execution of +mkdir+ and +cat+.

_Examples:_

* +ssh://kdump@crashdump/srv/www/dump/incoming+


Network File System (_nfs_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NFS is used to specify remote hosts that export their file system via NFS.
NFS doesn't use username and password. Also, the URL format cannot be used
to specify options. As default, the _nolock_ option is used.

_Format:_ *nfs*://_host_/_path_

_host_ is the hostname. _path_ specifies the path that is exported via NFS in
_/etc/exports_ (or a subdirectory of a path that is exported; the subdirectory
must exist before the crash is triggered).


_Examples:_

* +nfs://neptunium/var/crash+
* +nfs://10.10.2.120/var/crash+


Common Internet File System (_cifs_)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CIFS is used to specify remote hosts that export a file system via CIFS,
also known as SMB (although they are technically different, CIFS is the
successor of SMB). This could be a Microsoft Windows server, or a Samba
Server running on Unix or MacOS.

_Format:_ *cifs*://[_user_[:__password__]@]_host_/_path_

Although it's technically not 100 % correct, _smb_ is used as an alias for
_cifs_.

The parts of the URL are described in the FTP section above.
_path_ must exist before the crash is triggered.

*Note:* You have to use the slash as path separator, not the backslash as on
Microsoft Windows. 

_Examples:_

* +cifs://neptunium/var/crash+
* +cifs://bwalle:dontsay@neptunium/var/crash+
* +smb://bwalle@192.168.0.70/var/log+
