NAME
----
kdumptool - Binary to support kdump saving and loading

SYNOPSIS
--------
*kdumptool* [_global options_] _command_ [_options_] [_arguments_]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*kdumptool* provides various subcommands to support following actions for kdump.
It can:

- help to identify a kernel (whether it's relocatable or not, whether it's ELF
  or x86-style independent of the file name),
- save a dump over various transports (local file, SSH2, FTP, NFS, SMB),
- copy the kernel including debugging information from one directory to the
  dump directory over the same transports as the dump itself,
- delete old dumps,
- show the progress over the keyboard LED.

Because most functionality is needed in the _initrd_, the design decision was to
provide that functionality in one binary without huge dependencies and without
a scripting language.

To select which functionality is needed, one has to provide a _command_. So, for
example +kdump save_dump+ and +kdump copy_kernel+ is used to copy the kernel.
There are *global options* which are valid for all (sub)commands and there are
*normal options* which are only valid for a specific command. Also, the command
can take an arbitrary number of *arguments*.

Additional to the command line options described in that manual page, the
behavior is influenced by configuration options in _/etc/sysconfig/kdump_ (or a
different configuration file specified with the *-F* (*--configfile*) option.
Please read *kdump(5)* for documentation about the configuration options.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------

All option parsing is done via the *getopt_long(5)* function, and therefore
follows all standard command line parsing rules.

*-h* | *--help*::
  Shows help output and exits.

*-v* | *--version*::
  Shows version information and exits.

*-D* | *--debug*::
  Prints debugging information (to stderr). If the output is redirected to
  a terminal, then the various levels of debug information are colored. Use
  *-L* (*--logfile*) to redirect the debug output to a file.

*-L* _filename_ | *--logfile* _filename_::
  Redirects the debugging output to the logfile specified with _filename_.

*-F* _filename_ | *--configfile* _filename_::
  Use a different configuration file instead of _/etc/sysconfig/kdump_.

IDENTIFYING A KERNEL
--------------------

When finding a kernel that is suitable for kdump on the system, it's necessary
to know if that is a relocatable kernel. Historically, on every platform except
Itanium (IA64) kdump used a special kernel compiled with another start address.
That kernel had always "kdump" in its name on SUSE systems. If such a kernel is
found, that kernel is preferred. However, if there is no such kernel, the kdump
init script (_/etc/init.d/kdump_) looks for normal kernels that are relocatable.

Syntax
~~~~~~

*kdumptool* [_global options_] *identify_kernel* [-r] [-t]

It's necessary to provide either -r, -t or both.

Options
~~~~~~~

*-r* | *--relocatable*::
  Checks if the kernel is relocatable. If it is, it prints the string
  _Relocatable_ on stdout and exits with error code _0_. If it's not
  relocatable, then it prints _Not relocatable_ and exits with _2_.

*-t* | *--type*::
  Prints the type of the kernel. There are following types: _x86_ for the
  bzImage format, _ELF_ for a normal ELF binary and _ELF gzip_ for gzipped
  ELF binary.

LED BLINKING
------------

To indicate that kdump initrd is booted, the keyboard LEDs should be blinking
because VGA may be broken when dumping from X. That subcommand is used to
achieve that.

Syntax
~~~~~~

*kdumptool* [_global options_] *led_blink* [-i _interval_]

Options
~~~~~~~

*-i* _interval_ | *--interval* _interval_::
  Use _interval_ ms for the blink interval instead of the default 250 ms.

The command can only be executed as root.

RETURN VALUE
------------

*0*::
  Success.

*255*::
  Unknown Error.

*2*::
  Kernel has been identified but is not relocatable.

FILES
-----

_/etc/sysconfig/kdump_::
  Configuration file, see *kdump*(5).
