0.7.0
-----
  * Add read_ikconfig command.

    init script.
  * Implement KDUMP_VERBOSE = 16 to debug kdump find_kernel.

0.6.7
-----
  * Strip the whole crashkernel option when loading the kdump kernel, not only
    parts of them, also when the extended crashkernel syntax has been used.

0.6.6
-----
  * Fix wrong path when modifying the /etc/sysconfig/kdump file when creating
    the kdump initrd.
  * Prepend a space before MAKEDUMPFILE_OPTIONS so that there's always a space
    between command and the first argument.

0.6.5
-----
  * Fix copying of debug info when --root is specified and the debug file
    resides in GLOBALDEBUGDIR/EXECDIR/DEBUGFILE.

0.6.4
-----
  * change default location for KDUMP_SAVEDIR to "/var/crash"
  * actually check <version>-kdump before <version>-<flavour> when looking for
    a suitable kdump kernel
  * boot.kdump: Use the full kernel release (obtained with
    /sbin/get_kernel_version) to build the initrd name also when symlinks are
    used.
  * Assume a default terminal size of 80x25 (for printing the horizontal line)
  * Check the exit status of kdumptool
  * Implement support for resolving symbolic links inside a root directory
	(--root=...) when saving the dump.
  * Don't print a (red) info message that email failed if both KDUMP_SMTP_SERVER
    and KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_TO are empty.
  * If KDUMP_SAVEDIR points to a local file, resolve symlinks when creating the
    initrd because in theory the file system that contains parts of the symlinks
    is not mounted in initrd.
  * Fix KDUMP_NETCONFIG=auto by calling mkinitrd with right parameters.
  * Create core dumps in the initrd when kdumptool crashes.
  * Fix std::logic_error in Email::send() that caused kdumptool to terminate
    unexpectedly.
  * Set the hostname of the SMTP session based on the --fqdn parameter.
  * Don't report a failure in the email when there is no one.
